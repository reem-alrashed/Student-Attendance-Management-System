# Student Attendance Management System
Student Attendance Management System is a software program developed using C# programming language for easily record and view regular student attendance in schools, universities, and institutes. It helps to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular section. Three users are allowed to access the system and they are Admin, Teacher and Student, access is done through username and password with choosing user type. First of all, admin can add teachers and students specifying Name, id, username and password. The teacher can do some operations on a section such as add section, update section name and delete section. Also, the teacher can record student attendance and generate a report for students who their absence rate reaches 25% of the total contact hours. The report contains studentâ€™s information (i.e., name, id, section, number of absence hours, absence rate). This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student as it displays the absence hours and its corresponding absence rate when absence rate reaches 25% the report will contain the student name and id and that he/she has reached disciplinary notice. Students only can access their sections and printout attendance record including the number of absence hours as well as the corresponding absence rate.
